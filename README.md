# What is Web Scraping
Web scraping or web harvesting is a technique of extracting data from websites. The process involves fetching web pages, parsing their code, and saving the extracted information in a structured format for later use or analysis.
# Web Scraping with Python
- Inspecting the website's HTML to identify data elements.
- Using libraries like Requests to fetch pages and BeautifulSoup to parse and extract data.
- Exporting the results to a file or database.
# Things to remember while working on web scraping
- Request Headers: Some websites may block requests that look like they're from bots. You might need to add User-Agent headers to make your request look like itâ€™s from a real browser.
- Handling Pagination: If you're scraping multiple pages, you must handle pagination and loop through different URLs. Use proxy servers.
- Respecting robots.txt: Always check the site's robots.txt file to ensure you can scrape it.
